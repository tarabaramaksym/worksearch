# Cursor Rules for Job Dashboard Project

## Genera rules
- Do not create/implement features unless specifically asked to do so, e.g. if you are asked a question on how best to refactor something do not do it just provide examples/structure etc. first, but if told to do something instead of asked a question proceed with doing it without asking for permission
- Do not run commands yourself, just give the commands to the user to run on their own

## General File Creation Rules
- Do not add copyright messages

## Code Organization
- Keep consistent file structure
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Maintain proper indentation and spacing

## Project Structure
- Frontend: React application in `dashboard-fe/`
- Backend: Node.js server in `server/`
- Data crawler: Node.js application in `crawler/`
- Follow existing project conventions for each component
